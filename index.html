			<p>Hello, welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Cristian Portilla. I am currently enrolled in UNCC for Computer Coding. I enrolled to learn more on coding and be able to use that knowledge or skillset to my career. So far I have gotten really familiar to the basic and hope to really thrive and succed in this program. I have no career job at the moment, but hopefully all this time and knowlede I learn here will get me into one.</p>
			<p>A little more about me. I was born in July first 1994. In East Elmhurst, NY. I basically grow up there until I was fourteen and my family moved to Charlotte, North Carolina. Here I have met my wife and now a father of two beautiful girls. </p>
